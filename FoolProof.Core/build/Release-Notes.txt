- Dropped support for *.Net Framework 4.7.2* and *Net Standard 2.0*.
- Added support for *.Net 8*
- Added build target to copy required JavaScript files to the static assets folder (*wwwroot*).
- Improved *Date* and *Time* value handling in client-side validation, to use the browser's format function first.
- Added new parameter to client-side validation methods, to define the data type to convert values before validation.
- Added new property to *Comparison Validators* (descendant from *IsAttribute* or *RequiredIfAttribute*) to define the data type to use (*String*, *Number*, *Bool*, *Date*, *Time* or *DateTime*) in client-side validation. 
  If no value is provided for the *DataType* property, the data type is determined according to the *Type* of the *model property* (the property with the attribute).
